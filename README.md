# Rainfall-prediction

üåßÔ∏è Rainfall Prediction using Random Forest Classifier

This project predicts whether it will rain tomorrow based on historical weather data.
The model is built using a Random Forest Classifier, a robust ensemble machine learning method known for handling classification problems effectively.

üìÇ Project Files

Rain_Fall_Prediction.ipynb

Jupyter Notebook containing the full workflow:

Data preprocessing

Feature engineering

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Model training & evaluation (Random Forest Classifier)

Accuracy and performance metrics

rainfall_prediction_model.pkl

Serialized Random Forest model (saved using pickle)

Can be loaded directly for predictions without retraining

üöÄ Features

Handles missing values and categorical encoding

Implements Random Forest Classifier for rainfall prediction

Evaluates model performance using metrics like:

Accuracy

Confusion Matrix

Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)

Provides a ready-to-use trained model

üîß Requirements

To run the notebook or use the model, install the following dependencies:

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage
1. Run the Notebook

Open Rain_Fall_Prediction.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:

jupyter notebook Rain_Fall_Prediction.ipynb


Follow the steps to preprocess the dataset, train the model, and evaluate results.

2. Load the Pre-trained Model

You can use the rainfall_prediction_model.pkl file for direct predictions:

import pickle

# Load model
with open("rainfall_prediction_model.pkl", "rb") as f:
    model = pickle.load(f)

# Example: Predict rainfall
sample_input = [[25, 15, 80, 5]]  # Replace with actual feature values
prediction = model.predict(sample_input)
print("Rain Tomorrow:", "Yes" if prediction[0] == 1 else "No")

üìä Model Performance

Random Forest Classifier achieved high accuracy and balanced performance on training and testing data.

Detailed metrics are available in the notebook.

üìå Future Improvements

Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV

Deploying the model with a Flask/Django web app or Streamlit dashboard

Incorporating additional weather datasets for higher generalization

‚ú® This project demonstrates how machine learning can assist in weather forecasting by predicting rainfall patterns.
